- Make magic block schematics and have them generate underground

- Get enchanting table finished/working

- Get tool repair finished/working

DONE - make energy orb powder images

- Do something with pick/axe/sword blocks. Maybe generate on land?

- Why are there many picks in inventory and no axes or swords

- What is the gem block for?

- magic wands don't seem to be started besides images
    - I think they are for special powers like speed and fly
    
- What nodes need crafts?

DONE - Check mapgen for orbs and crystals - You collect them when you mine stone

- make magic sword crafting table. How to get sword pieces? Don't bother with this for now

DONE - Label forges better

- remove crafting for sword, axe and armour

I am thinking that we should have magic potions for fly, speed, jump etc

The wands can be for turning water into ice, stone into lava, etc
