- Make magic block schematics and have them generate underground

DONE - Get enchanting table finished/working

- Get tool repair finished/working

DONE - make energy orb powder images

- Do something with pick/axe/sword blocks. Maybe generate on land?

- Why are there many picks in inventory and no axes or swords

- What is the gem block for? When you place it you pick the color, If you have other gem blocks they all change instead of just one
    - When you click on activate it should remove the crystal from inventory and run code but it does not
    - I think the idea was to have an item spawn when opened. The code says spawn a gem but there are no gems coded yet
    - I will do gem pictures and set up the code. They can be crafting items.

- magic wands don't seem to be started besides images
    - I think they are for special powers like speed and fly
    
- What nodes need crafts?

DONE - Check mapgen for orbs and crystals - You collect them when you mine stone

- make magic sword crafting table. How to get sword pieces? Don't bother with this for now

DONE - Label forges better

- remove crafting for sword, axe and armour

- make crafts for items that do not have them

I am thinking that we should have magic potions for fly, speed, jump etc

The wands can be for turning water into ice, stone into lava, etc
