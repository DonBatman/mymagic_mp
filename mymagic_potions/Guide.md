How to get Mana Crystals and Void Orbs

1. Mana Crystals (The Common Fuel)

Mana Crystals are the standard battery for your brewing stand.

Mining: They are found in Mana Ore blocks that spawn deep underground (below Y=-100). Mining them with a stone pickaxe or better yields mymagic:mana_crystal.

Crystal Growth: In some magic mods, Mana Crystals can be "grown" by dropping a Mese Crystal into a pool of liquid mana, though mining is the default method provided in the code below.

2. Void Orbs (The High-Tier Fuel)

Void Orbs provide significantly more brewing "charges" and are much harder to find.

Mob Drops: They are rare drops from "Void" enemies or Enderman-style mobs.

Dungeon Loot: They can be found in treasure chests within Desert Temples or Dungeons.

The Void: They can sometimes be found as rare ores near the very bottom of the world (near the lava layer/cavern floor).

3. Sustainability

The brewing stand logic I provided uses Item Wear. This means:

A Mana Crystal won't disappear immediately; it will slowly "crack" (show a damage bar) and last for 3 brewing cycles.

A Void Orb is much more durable, lasting for 8 brewing cycles before shattering.
