Once you craft the table you can enchant your tools and armor. You can enchant shovels, axes, swords and picks. 
You can also enchant diamond armor. You have to follow this color order to enchant.

In the enchanting table put your tool or armor into the table and add 4 orbs. Click enchant and your done.
